v2.05.30000 (Feb 1, 2009)  [urnati]
- Special thanks to djDan for providing a Russion localization file!
- Added a button to the quest details menu (2nd menu) which will open
the quest log at that quest. Other addons that 'override' the quest log
will work such as Lightheaded or Carbonite.
- Fixes:
-- Error when selecting Add / Remove from Watcher in the quest details 
menu (2nd menu)
-- Error in startup - I think this is fixed since I do not see the 
error. Please post or PM if not.

   -- made usEN a separate file
   -- put localization within TitanQuests to reduce global namespace
   
v2.02.30000 (Jan 1, 2009)  [urnati]
- Special thanks to PatoDaia for a proper Spanish translation and for 
localizing some hard-coded strings.
If anyone has translations for other languages - please send me a message!
I did not realize PatoDaia would respond so quickly or I would have 
combined the last fix into a single release.

v2.01.30000 (Jan 1, 2009)  [urnati]
- Fixed an error on left click to properly open the Blizzard quest log. 

v2.00.30000 (Sep 28, 2008)  [urnati]
- Incremented the release to 2.xx to denote this is Lich King only.
- Updated because of changes in Titan Panel 4.0.0.30000r901. 
The changes are NOT backwards compatible.
If you run an older version of TitanQuests in the new Titan Panel, 
you will not get any errors but Titan Quests will not be displayed. 
Nor will you be able to enable it using Titan Panel.
- Tightened some default checking when getting quest info. It is possible that
a quest does not return a valid 'quality' (green | blue | ...) so the default
is 'gray' when this happens. Not sure if this is a feature or a bug.

v1.03.30000 (Sep 21, 2008)  [urnati]
- Updated because of changes in Titan Panel. The changes are backwards compatible.

v1.02.20400 (Aug 10, 2008)  [urnati]

v1.01.20400 (Aug 7, 2008)  [urnati]
- Cosmetic updates to make the version number consistent 
in Blizzard Addons screen and in Titan Panel plugin itself.

v1.00.20400 (Aug 2, 2008)  [urnati]

- The main quest list now includes the suggested group size
- The main quest list now includes the number of party members on the same quest
- The quest submenu now includes the party members on the same quest
- Changed _OnLoad so Titan will show proper version.
